# MyZ Annotator Terms of Service

**Effective date:** 2025-11-04

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the MyZ Annotator browser extension (the "Extension"). By installing or using the Extension you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not install or use the Extension.

## 1. Eligibility
You may use the Extension only if you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement in your jurisdiction. If you use the Extension on behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that person or entity to these Terms.

## 2. License and Acceptable Use
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to install and use the Extension for personal or internal business purposes. You may not:
- reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Extension except as permitted by applicable law;
- remove proprietary notices or other markers embedded in the Extension;
- use the Extension to violate any applicable law or third-party rights;
- use the Extension in a manner that interferes with or disrupts its operation for other users.

## 3. Data Handling and Privacy
The Extension operates entirely within your browser. We do not collect, store, transmit, or otherwise process any personal information or highlight data on servers controlled by the project maintainers. All highlights, settings, authentication tokens, and Internet Archive queues remain in your browser storage unless you share them yourself.

## 4. Optional Integrations
The Extension provides optional integrations that you may enable at your sole discretion:
- **LogSeq Sync:** When enabled, your highlights are sent directly from your browser to the LogSeq HTTP API endpoint that you configure.
- **Internet Archive Support:** When enabled, the Extension submits the page URL (and any credentials you provide) directly to the Internet Archive.

We do not operate, control, or monitor these services. You are solely responsible for ensuring that you have the right to use any third-party service, for understanding their privacy policies, and for bearing all risks associated with enabling integrations.

## 5. Third-Party Content
The Extension allows you to annotate content that may be protected by copyright or other rights. You are responsible for ensuring that your use complies with all applicable laws, terms of the websites you visit, and any third-party rights.

## 6. No Warranties
THE EXTENSION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOUR USE OF THE EXTENSION IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROJECT MAINTAINERS AND CONTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE EXTENSION OR OPTIONAL INTEGRATIONS.

## 8. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the project maintainers and contributors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the Extension or violation of these Terms.

## 9. Termination
We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Extension at any time without notice. You may terminate your use by uninstalling the Extension. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive, including Sections 3 through 10.

## 10. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the effective date above. Your continued use of the Extension after the Terms change constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 11. Contact
If you have questions about these Terms, please open an issue on the [project repository](https://github.com/myz-suite/myz-support/issues).
