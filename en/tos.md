# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** 2025-11-04

These Terms of Service govern how you may use the MyZ Annotator and MyZ Danmaku browser extensions. Installing or using either extension means you accept these terms.

## Eligibility
You must have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement in your jurisdiction. If you use the extension on behalf of an organization, you confirm that you are authorized to bind that organization to these terms.

## License and Acceptable Use
You receive a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to install and use the extensions for personal or internal business purposes. Do not reverse engineer the extensions (unless permitted by law), remove notices, or use them to violate any law or third-party rights.

## Local-Only Data Handling
All highlights, danmaku caches, settings, credentials, and Internet Archive queue information remain inside your browser storage. The maintainers do **not** collect or process your data on any server.

## Optional Integrations
- **LogSeq Sync:** Sends highlights directly from your browser to the LogSeq HTTP API endpoint that you configure.
- **Internet Archive Support:** Submits the page URL (and any credentials you provide) directly to the Internet Archive.
- **MyZ Danmaku Overlay:** Uses YouTube’s private interfaces from your browser to fetch public comments and generate danmaku locally. You must comply with YouTube/Google policies.

These integrations are entirely optional and under your control. You are responsible for the consequences of enabling them and for complying with the third parties’ terms and policies.

## Third-Party Content and Services
You are solely responsible for ensuring that annotating or archiving content complies with all applicable laws, website terms, and third-party rights.

## No Warranties & Limitation of Liability
The extensions are provided "as is" without any warranty. Use them at your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the maintainers and contributors are not liable for any indirect or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the extensions or optional integrations. For MyZ Danmaku specifically, Google may change or restrict access to these private interfaces at any time. If that results in account limitations, playback failures, or other issues, you bear the responsibility.

## Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the maintainers and contributors against claims or losses stemming from your use of the extension or violation of these terms.

## Termination and Changes
We may modify or discontinue the extension without notice. You may stop using it at any time by uninstalling the extension. We may update these terms occasionally; the effective date will change accordingly. Continued use means you accept the updates.
