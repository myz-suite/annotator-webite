# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** 2026-01-12

These Terms of Service govern how you may use the MyZ AI Annotator and MyZ Danmaku Viewer browser extensions. Installing or using either extension means you accept these terms.

## Eligibility
You must have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement in your jurisdiction. If you use the extension on behalf of an organization, you confirm that you are authorized to bind that organization to these terms.

## License and Acceptable Use
You receive a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to install and use the extensions for personal or internal business purposes. Do not reverse engineer the extensions (unless permitted by law), remove notices, or use them to violate any law or third-party rights.

## Local-Only Data Handling
All highlights, danmaku caches, settings, and credentials remain inside your browser storage. The maintainers operate **no remote service** to receive, store, or process your data.

## Optional Features
- **Custom AI Provider:** You may configure an OpenAI-compatible API (Base URL, API key, headers, models). Requests are sent directly from your browser to the servers you provide.
- **MCP Servers:** You may configure MCP server endpoints and headers so the extension can list tools and run tool calls by sending requests directly from your browser to your configured servers.
- **Social Import (X/Mastodon):** Import by opening pages and scraping content in your browser (no official API). You may need to be logged in.
- **MyZ Danmaku Viewer:** Uses YouTube’s private interfaces from your browser to fetch public comments and generate danmaku locally. You must comply with YouTube/Google policies.

These features are entirely optional and under your control. You are responsible for the consequences of enabling them and for complying with third-party terms and policies. In particular:

- Any custom AI Provider / MCP Server is chosen and controlled by you. Their security, compliance, availability, logging/retention, and billing are determined by those service operators—you must assess and accept the risks.
- Using a custom AI Provider can consume a large amount of tokens and incur significant charges. You are solely responsible for understanding the pricing and paying the fees.
- Social import accesses third-party websites and scrapes content. Availability and results can change due to site policies, rate limits, anti-abuse controls, or layout changes. You are responsible for deciding whether to enable it and for any consequences (including account limitations).
- Do not send sensitive or private data to third-party servers unless you fully understand and accept their data-handling practices.
- We do not provide any remote service and are not responsible for any loss, leakage, charges, disputes, or liabilities caused by your use of third-party servers (including custom AI Providers and MCP Servers).
- We are also not responsible for any risks, disputes, or losses resulting from your use of the social import feature.

## Third-Party Content and Services
You are solely responsible for ensuring that annotating or reusing content complies with all applicable laws, website terms, and third-party rights.

## No Warranties & Limitation of Liability
The extensions are provided "as is" without any warranty. Use them at your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the maintainers and contributors are not liable for any indirect or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the extensions or optional features. For MyZ Danmaku Viewer specifically, Google may change or restrict access to these private interfaces at any time. If that results in account limitations, playback failures, or other issues, you bear the responsibility.

## Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the maintainers and contributors against claims or losses stemming from your use of the extension or violation of these terms.

## Termination and Changes
We may modify or discontinue the extension without notice. You may stop using it at any time by uninstalling the extension. We may update these terms occasionally; the effective date will change accordingly. Continued use means you accept the updates.
