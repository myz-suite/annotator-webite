## Risk notice

- MyZ Danmaku runs entirely on your device. We do not receive or proxy any browsing data.
- The extension relies on YouTube’s private endpoints to fetch public comments. Google may rate-limit or block aggressive traffic. If that happens—such as account restrictions or playback errors—you assume the risk and impact.
