## Get started

1. Pin the extension icon to the toolbar so you can open it quickly.
2. Select any text on the page—the floating toolbar appears next to your selection so you can highlight, underline, add wavy lines, or 📸 capture a screenshot.
3. The badge on the toolbar icon shows how many highlights exist on the current page.
4. Open the popup or dashboard to manage highlights: search, filter by tag, import/export, and downgrade entries to plain text when needed.

## FAQ highlights

- **How do I export to Markdown?** Use the detail panel or the dashboard’s “Copy Markdown” action.
- **What if the page is an SPA and navigation resets my highlights?** The extension monitors URL changes and replays highlights. If locating fails, the popup and dashboard will flag the entry so you can downgrade it.
- **How do I sync with LogSeq?** Configure your LogSeq HTTP API URL/token in the settings panel. The extension performs incremental syncs directly to your environment.
